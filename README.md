## 👋 Hi there, I'm Isabel!

Welcome to my GitHub! I work at the intersection of open-source, data science tooling, and delightful developer experiences. I built and maintain the Python side of **[vetiver](https://github.com/rstudio/vetiver-python)** and am the current maintainer of the **[pins](https://github.com/rstudio/pins-python)** Python package. I've also served as Editor in Chief at **[pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/)**, currently still editing and reviewing great work. These days, I primarily work on **[Positron](https://positron.posit.co/)**, an IDE built for data work.


Beyond coding, I share my home (and sometimes my keyboard) with my two dogs, two cats, and Madagascar day gecko. You’ll usually find me reading something from my endless to-read list or making crafts. I'm currently working on lots of bookbinding projects! ✂️
